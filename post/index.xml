      <description>Problem Statement A Bank wants to take care of customer retention for its product: savings accounts. The bank wants you to identify customers likely to churn balances below the minimum balance. I have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank. My task as a data scientist would be to predict the propensity to churn for each customer. Link to Github Repository</description>

      <title> Fashion Image Classifier using Keras </title>
      <link>https://santosh175.github.io/me_portfolio/post/project-1/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement It is an example of multi class classification problem . Here, our model has to classify a given fashion image into which class it belongs to out of 10 classes. It is a simple neural network model , trained on Fashion MNIST dataset. It has been implemented using Keras Sequential API. Dataset It is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of 28*28 pixels each, with 10 classes. It is very similar to MNIST dataset but here each class is more diverse and thus problem is comparatively more challenging.</description>
